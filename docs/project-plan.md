# Publish-It — Project Plan

> **`stdout` for the web** — one command, one URL, done.

A minimal CLI + service that takes markdown and publishes it to a stable URL. Built for AI agents, used by humans. Extreme minimalism, speed, simplicity — like [[telegra.ph]] but for the terminal era.

**MVP scope**: personal publishing endpoint for the builder + a few power users. Design constraint: keep CLI/API portable for future hosting. Non-goal for MVP: polished multi-user public hosting business.

## Why Build This

- JotBird exists but: 10 doc free limit, 30-day link expiry, $29/yr for permanence, not self-owned infra
- Telegra.ph: no real markdown, no CLI, Telegram-ecosystem locked
- Rentry.co: close but no OG tags, no frontmatter, no versioning, not yours
- **If you can one-shot it, why pay?** Own your publishing infra, customize freely

## Philosophy

1. **One command** — `pub publish note.md` → URL. That's it.
2. **Stable URLs** — published once, lives forever (or until you delete it)
3. **Re-publish** — edit locally, run again, same URL updates
4. **AI-native** — API-first, pipe-friendly, zero browser requirement. CLI + HTTP API covers everything; MCP/skills are just wrappers if needed later
5. **Extreme minimalism** — the [[telegra.ph]] way. No bloat. No features you don't use.

## Core Features (v0.1 — MVP)

### CLI
- `pub claim <namespace>` — claim your namespace, get API token
- `pub publish <file.md>` — publish or update markdown (idempotent — first call creates, subsequent calls update same URL)
- `pub publish <file.md> --slug custom-name` — custom URL slug
- `pub list` — show your published pages
- `pub remove <slug>` — delete a page
- Pipe support: `cat report.md | pub publish`

### Service
- **URL format**: `pub.domain/namespace/slug`
- Clean markdown rendering (GFM + syntax highlighting). Math/Mermaid deferred — add when requested.
- Frontmatter contract: `title`, `slug`, `draft`, `noindex`, `visibility` → parsed for OG tags and page metadata
- `noindex` by default (opt-in to search indexing via frontmatter)
- Sub-second response times

### Auth
- [[telegra.ph]]-model: claim namespace → get token → store in `~/.config/pub/config.json`
- Token hashed server-side (SHA-256)
- No OAuth, no email, no browser needed
- Token rotation via `pub token rotate`

## Architecture

**Pre-render on publish, serve static from CDN.** Rendering cost is paid once by the publisher, never by the reader.

```
PUBLISH FLOW (function invocation):
CLI or curl
  ↓ HTTP POST with Bearer token + markdown body
Edge Function (Hono)
  ↓ remark/rehype pipeline renders markdown → HTML
  ↓ Stores raw .md + pre-rendered .html to public CDN-backed storage
  ↓ Updates metadata in KV
Storage:
  - KV: namespace→token_hash, page_id→metadata, slug→page_id lookups
  - Object storage (R2/Blob): raw markdown + pre-rendered HTML

READ FLOW (zero compute — pure CDN):
Reader hits URL → CDN serves pre-rendered .html directly from object storage
  No function invocation. No compute. Just a static file from the edge.
  Target: < 30ms TTFB globally, < 20KB page weight, effectively free at any scale.
```

**Implementation note (2026-03-19):** current production uses a private Blob store for metadata and a public Blob store for content. On Vercel, the deployed app currently serves reads through Hono with aggressive edge-cache headers, so the first read may hit the function but subsequent reads are CDN-served. The pure CDN no-function read path and KV metadata split remain the target architecture.

### Why This Stack
- **Vercel**: free tier generous, edge CDN fast, blob storage simple
- **Hono**: minimal framework, runs on edge, ~14KB
- **Node 22 + TypeScript**: current implementation target, portable between local dev and Vercel-style hosting. Bun packaging can be added later if single-binary distribution matters.
- **remark/rehype**: same pipeline Quartz uses, handles GFM + Obsidian-flavored MD
- No database needed for MVP — KV + Blob is enough
- **curl as first-class client**: `curl -X POST --data-binary @file.md` — zero install publishing

### Why Pre-render (not render-on-read)
- Read path is a static file serve — as fast as Telegraph or faster
- No cold starts, no compute on read, no cache invalidation complexity
- Page weight stays minimal: only include syntax highlight CSS if page has code, KaTeX only if page has math
- Zero JS, zero external requests — just HTML + inlined CSS
- **System fonts only**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — no Google Fonts, no font files, no extra HTTP requests. Mono: `ui-monospace, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace`

## Rendering Pipeline (runs once at publish time)

```
Markdown (raw)
  → remark-parse (AST)
  → remark-gfm (tables, strikethrough, task lists)
  → remark-frontmatter (YAML extraction → OG tags + page metadata)
  → rehype (HTML AST)
  → rehype-highlight (syntax highlighting) — only if code blocks detected
  → rehype-sanitize (XSS prevention)
  → HTML string
  → Wrap in minimal template (< 5KB CSS, conditional includes)
  → Store as .html blob (this is what readers get)
```

## URL Scheme

```
pub.domain/                      → landing page (minimal)
pub.domain/namespace/            → namespace index (list of pages)
pub.domain/namespace/slug        → published page
pub.domain/namespace/slug?raw    → raw markdown
pub.domain/namespace/slug?v=2    → specific version (future)
```

## Data Model (MVP)

Each page has an internal `page_id` (UUID) that users never see. The slug is the public URL. This separation is cheap now and enables renames/redirects/versioning later without breaking URLs.

```
KV keys:
  ns:{namespace}                    → { token_hash, created_at, last_publish_at }
  page:{page_id}                    → { slug, namespace, title, created_at, updated_at, blob_key, views }
  lookup:{namespace}/{slug}         → page_id

Blob:
  {page_id}.md                      → raw markdown content
  {page_id}.html                    → pre-rendered HTML (what readers get)

Local .pub mapping:
  { "report.md": { "slug": "quarterly-report", "page_id": "a1b2c3..." } }
```

**Future extensions (zero-cost to add later):**
- Renames: `redirect:{namespace}/{old-slug} → page_id` + update lookup key
- Revisions: `rev:{page_id}:v{n} → { blob_key, published_at }` + `current_version` field
- Graduate to Postgres when KV queries become painful (listing, search, etc.)

## Milestones

### M0: Spike (1 day)
- [ ] Vercel project + domain setup
- [x] Single Hono publish route: POST markdown → pre-render HTML → store raw markdown + pre-rendered HTML → return URL
- [x] Single Hono read route: GET URL → fetch pre-rendered HTML → serve it (no rendering on read)
- [x] Auth path implemented locally (namespace claiming shipped earlier than originally planned)
- [x] **Goal**: local publish flow produces working URLs with pre-rendered HTML

**Current note:** deployment is live on Vercel and aliased to `bul.sh`. The local and production publish flows are both verified. Content is stored in Blob; rendered HTML responses are edge-cached aggressively on Vercel.

### M1: CLI + Auth (2-3 days)
- [x] `pub claim`, `pub publish` (idempotent create/update), `pub list`, `pub remove`
- [x] Namespace claiming with token generation
- [x] Token storage in `~/.config/pub/config.json`
- [x] `.pub` mapping file (like JotBird's `.jotbird`) for file→slug+page_id tracking
- [x] Pipe support (`cat file.md | pub publish`)
- [x] **Goal**: full publish/delete flow works (publish is idempotent — handles both create and update)

### M2: Polish Rendering (1-2 days)
- [x] Full remark/rehype pipeline with GFM + syntax highlighting (math/Mermaid deferred)
- [x] Minimal CSS theme (< 5KB, dark/light, responsive)
- [x] Frontmatter → OG meta tags
- [x] Favicon
- [x] **Goal**: published pages look clean and professional

### M3: Nice-to-Haves (ongoing)
- [ ] `--watch` mode (re-publish on file save)
- [ ] Math/KaTeX + Mermaid rendering (add when requested)
- [ ] Page versioning (keep history, show diffs) — data model already supports this
- [ ] Page renames with redirects — data model already supports this
- [ ] View count analytics
- [ ] Page collections with auto-generated index
- [ ] Expiring pages (TTL)
- [ ] Custom domains (namespace.pub.domain)
- [ ] Web editor (CodeMirror with markdown + live preview)
- [ ] Batch publish API
- [ ] MCP server (if demand exists)

## Things to Decide

- [ ] **Name**: `pub`? `md.pub`? `mdpost`? `pushmd`? Need a good domain.
- [ ] **Free tier limits**: unlimited pages? Rate limit only? Storage cap?
- [ ] **Subdomain vs path**: `namespace.domain` vs `domain/namespace` — start with path, add subdomain later?
- [ ] **Markdown flavor**: strict GFM or also support Obsidian-flavored ([[wikilinks]], ==highlights==, callouts)?
- [ ] **Default visibility**: unlisted (noindex) or public?
